    "answer": "GKE or App Engine Flexible",
    "explanation": "App Engine Standard is limited to specific runtimes/sandboxes. Flexible and GKE allow custom containers with OS dependencies.",

    "question": "Scenario: You need to store legal documents for 7 years for compliance, but they will rarely be accessed. Which storage class?",
    "answer": "Archive Storage",
    "explanation": "Archive is the cheapest for storage but expensive for retrieval. Ideal for 'write once, read never' compliance data.",

    "question": "Scenario: You want to minimize costs for a fault-tolerant batch processing job. Which VM type?",
    "answer": "Spot VMs (Preemptible)",
    "explanation": "Spot VMs are up to 91% cheaper but can be terminated by Google at any time. Perfect for stateless batch jobs that can retry.",

    "answer": "Private Services Access (VPC Peering)",
    "explanation": "Cloud SQL lives in a Google-managed VPC. Peering bridges your VPC to theirs, allowing private IP communication.",

    "question": "Scenario: You deployed a new version of an App Engine service but users report bugs. How to rollback instantly?",
    "answer": "Split traffic 100% back to the previous version",
    "explanation": "App Engine keeps old versions running (unless stopped). You can instantly route 100% of traffic back to V1 via Console or CLI.",

    "question": "Scenario: You need to grant a temporary contractor access to upload files to one specific bucket. How?",
    "answer": "Grant 'Storage Object Creator' role on the bucket (Resource-level IAM)",
    "explanation": "Least Privilege: Don't give project-wide access. Use IAM conditions or resource-level bindings on just that bucket.",

    "question": "Scenario: Your GKE cluster needs to scale based on the number of requests per second (RPS), not CPU. What do you use?",
    "answer": "Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with Custom Metrics",
    "explanation": "Default HPA scales on CPU/Memory. For application metrics (RPS), you need to export custom metrics to Stackdriver and use the external metrics adapter.",

    "question": "Scenario: You deleted a VM instance but the external static IP is still billing you. Why?",
    "answer": "Static IPs are billed when reserved but UNATTACHED.",
    "explanation": "If an IP is attached to a running VM, it's free (included). If it's reserved but not used, Google charges an hourly fee to discourage hoarding.",

    "question": "Scenario: You need to SSH into a VM that has no external IP address. How?",

    "explanation": "IAP allows SSH access via Google's centralized proxy, authenticated by IAM, without exposing the VM to the public internet.",
